        1. Sentence Structure: Replaced uniform, formal sentences with varied lengths and natural rhythm
        2. Language Style: Added contractions, casual phrases, and conversational tone
        3. Content Enhancement: Included specific examples and personal anecdotes instead of generic statements
        4. Flow Improvement: Removed robotic transitions and created organic paragraph connections
        5. Authenticity Markers: Added minor imperfections and natural speech patterns that humans use

        These modifications target common AI detection patterns while preserving factual accuracy and readability.
