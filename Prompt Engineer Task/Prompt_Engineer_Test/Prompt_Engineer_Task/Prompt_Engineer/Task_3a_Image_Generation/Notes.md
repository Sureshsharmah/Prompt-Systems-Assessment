
        Scaling to 10-Image Series Strategy:

        Consistency Framework:
        1. Color Palette: Strict adherence to grayscale + #30C9CB teal accent
        2. Lighting: Consistent natural/professional lighting across all images
        3. Composition: Maintain minimalist, clean aesthetic with similar framing
        4. Subject Matter: Rotate between people, objects, and abstract elements
        5. Accent Placement: Strategic teal placement as focal point in each image

        Technical Specifications:
        - Resolution: 1024x1024 for all images
        - Style Keywords: "photorealistic", "grayscale", "minimalist", "professional"
        - Lighting: "natural lighting", "high contrast", "clean shadows"
        - Quality: HD generation for crisp details

        Variation Strategy:
        - 3-4 images with human subjects (different poses/settings)
        - 3-4 images with objects/workspaces
        - 2-3 abstract/geometric compositions
        - Consistent teal accent integration across all variations

        Quality Control:
        - Test prompts for color accuracy
        - Verify grayscale consistency
        - Ensure professional aesthetic alignment
        
        Azure Deployment Requirements:
        - DALL-E-3 deployment required for actual image generation
        - Alternative: Use external image generation APIs (Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)
        - Fallback: Generate detailed prompts for manual image creation
