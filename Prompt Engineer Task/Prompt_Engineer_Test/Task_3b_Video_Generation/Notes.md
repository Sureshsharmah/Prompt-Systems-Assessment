
        Maintaining Consistency Across 5-Video Series:

        Visual Consistency:
        1. Color Grading: Establish LUT/color profile for uniform look
        2. Lighting Setup: Consistent lighting ratios and temperature
        3. Framing: Maintain similar shot compositions and aspect ratios
        4. Typography: Standardized font, size, and positioning for text overlays

        Technical Consistency:
        1. Duration Control: Strict timing guidelines for each segment
        2. Motion Parameters: Consistent camera movement speeds and styles
        3. Transition Types: Standardized transition effects between scenes
        4. Quality Settings: Uniform resolution, frame rate, and compression

        Content Consistency:
        1. Narrative Structure: Follow same 4-part story arc for each video
        2. Visual Metaphors: Consistent symbolic elements (clutter = confusion, clean = success)
        3. Character Continuity: Same actor/persona across series when possible
        4. Brand Elements: Consistent logo placement, color scheme, and style

        Production Workflow:
        1. Storyboard Templates: Pre-designed layouts for each video type
        2. Asset Library: Reusable elements (fonts, colors, transitions)
        3. Review Process: Consistency checklist before final render
        4. Version Control: Track successful elements for replication

        Platform Optimization:
        - Multiple aspect ratios (16:9, 9:16, 1:1) from same source
        - Subtitle positioning consistency
        - Thumbnail style alignment
